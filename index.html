    <h3>False God or Actual Prophet?</h3>

      <p>On May 28, 2016, a three-year-old boy climbed into a gorilla enclosure at the Cincinnati Zoo
        and Botanical Garden and was grabbed and dragged by Harambe, a 17-year-old Western lowland gorilla.
        Fearing for the boy's life, a zoo worker shot and killed Harambe. The incident was recorded on video
        and received broad international coverage and commentary, including controversy over the choice to
        kill Harambe. A number of primatologists and conservationists wrote later that the zoo had no other
        choice under the circumstances, and that it highlighted the danger of zoo animals in close proximity
        to humans and the need for better standards of care.
